## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
    - The initial challenge was deciding what to actually do but I figured I would do something for a community I care about with is my commiunity of arsenal fans and a board which shows upcoming games. It was fun to make because I am interested in arsenal.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
